## To-Do

VitalList is in a continuous state of development. New features/updates may come at any time. Some pending ideas are:

  * Bot Widgets
  * Bot Re-submit Option
  * Website Themes
  * Optimize the code

## Config

  * The domain variable should includes the protocol and **doesn't end** with a `/`. Eg, `http://localhost:8080`.
  * All the roles should be below the role of the bot that controls the list.
  * Most of the variables are Discord IDs.
  * The MongoDB URL can be either a local server or a remote one. Atlas provides a free tier with 500mb.
  * The minimum and maximum lengths for bot / server description and summary are in characters.
